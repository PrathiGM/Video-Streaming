Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a powerful combination of S3 buckets and CloudFront to address the challenges associated with scalable and reliable video delivery. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) offers a highly durable and scalable storage solution, allowing for the secure and cost-effective management of large volumes of video content. Its ability to automatically scale with demand ensures that videos are  readily available, supporting varying levels of user traffic.
